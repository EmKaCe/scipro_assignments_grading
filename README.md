This repository contains the html and json documents needed for grading the course Scientific Programming with Python given at University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. The html document can be given to grading helpers for their evaluation of homework assignments. When they open it on their local browswer, the content, given as json files, should be downloaded from this repository automatically.

Usage: Graders should open the html document (e.g. `firefox Grading_template_json.html`, and click on the feedback items that are appropriate. At the end of the document there is a `Generate` button, which will take the clicked items and compile the text into the bottom window. One can then copy-and-paste the feedback as desired. Upon a new feedback (i.e. another student's solution), click the `Reset` button at the top. The floating `Grading` window is just for personal point tallying, and doesn't currently contribute to the compiling via the `Generate` button.
