This repository contains the HTML and JSON documents needed for grading the course Scientific Programming with Python given at the University of Applied Sciences Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. The HTML document can be given to grading helpers for their evaluation of homework assignments. When they open it on their local browser, the content, given as JSON files, should be downloaded from this repository automatically.

**Usage**: Graders should open the HTML document (e.g. `firefox grading_template_json.html`, and click on the feedback items that are appropriate. At the end of the document, there is a `Generate` button, which will take the clicked items and compile the text into the bottom window. One can then copy-and-paste the feedback as desired. Upon a new feedback (i.e. another student's solution), click the `Reset` button at the top. The floating `Grading` window is just for personal point tallying, and doesn't currently contribute to the compiling via the `Generate` button.

**Modifying**: The following information is for those who want to use this as a template in their own courses. The `references.json` file contains links to this GitHub repository, which you will need to modify to link to your own repository. The folder `criteria` cotains the general feedback suitable for all assignments and assignement specific feedback. The `references.json` is the main JSON file that will link to the others within criteria` folder.

**Browsers Tested**: Mozilla Firefox and Chrome

**Contribution**
1. Karl N. Kirschner - conceptualization, feedback content and maintenance
2. Abanoub Abdelmalak - conceptualization and early HTML prototyping
3. Minh Truong - JSON coding
