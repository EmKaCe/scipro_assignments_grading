Evaluation:  General Feedback 


Following Instructions:

Negative:
•  You did not follow the assignment's instructions, which includes:
      - not putting your name at the top of the assignment


Academic Scholarship (Citations and Writing):

Neutral:
•  Generally good citing of information, but with a few issues that include:
      - being careful when citing websites - when possible cite peer-reviewed papers or academic books

Negative:
•  Poorly citing information, which includes the following:
      - not citing Python3 libraries that were used:
          Numpy

Additional Notes: 
  You need to improve your academic scholarship.


Jupyter Notebooks:

Positive:
•  Overall Notebook Structure:
      - Good use of cells structure to separate ideas (e.g. thoughts, tasks/subtasks, user-defined functions).


Code Formatting:

Positive:
•  Very good code formatting that includes:
      - all libraries used were alphabetized
      - proper f-string statements

Negative:
•  The following formatting issues were present in your code:
      - too many blank lines were used
      - inconsistent or poor indentation (i.e. 4 spaces)


Coding Concept:

Positive:
•  Good use of data structures that includes:
      - lists (e.g. my_list = [item_1, item_2, item_3])


User-defined Functions:

Positive:
•  Good use of the following:
      - including type hinting
      - stating what the function does
      - stating what the input objects are (i.e. they are defined)

Neutral:
•  The use of 'assert' over 'raise' statements:
      - It is better to use a 'raise' statement since 'assert' statements can be bypassed. Note that for development work, the use of 'assert' is okay.

Negative:
•  Your user-defined functions had the following problems:
      - a lack of type hinting


General Feedback:

Positive:
      - Excellent job on this assignment!


 Assignment Specific Feedback 


Significant Figures:

Positive:
      - Your numbers are reported with the correct significant figures.


Plotting (Pandas or Matplotlib):

Positive:
•  Overall plot feedback:
      - The choices behind the plot creation were well done, resulting in clear and informative data presentation.

Neutral:
•  Overall plot feedback:
      - The choices behind the plot creation were generally good, but there is some room for improvement.

Negative:
•  The choice in the following plot elements could have been done better:
      - axis labels

Additional Notes: 
  Nice plots overall.


Numpy Library:

Positive:
•  The following points were well done:
      - good job on using ndarrays for your Numpy-based function


SciPy Library:

Negative:
      - You needed to use SciPy's optimize function to find the optimal value of the variable.


SciPy - Mountains:

Neutral:
•  Pandas:
      - Should have dropped duplicate data values and any rows that had missing data.

Negative:
•  RMSE:
      - A user-defined RMSE function was an obvious to create here.
